# NM Whos Who

## Description
You’ll be working with a cross-functional engineering team to deliver PoC’s and experiments; you’ll be the lead engineer. To demonstrate excellence in modern development tools and frameworks, we ask that you complete the following challenge. Please use this test to show off your skill set and what you can bring to the team. You will be critiqued on your quality, completeness, creativity, and technologies. If we proceed forward in the interviewing process, you will be asked to walk through your code. Choose modern technologies that exercise the breadth of approach and ones that you’re comfortable developing with.
When you have completed the following challenge, place your code in a code repository, ex. github, bitbucket, dropbox, etc.

## Mission/Challenge
Create a responsive (phone, tablet, desktop) web application that allows the user to quick filter a list of things. The top of the page will have a search input field and then below that a list of things in response to the filter. The things should be sorted alphabetically. The things could be anything, but should be AJAX pulled from a backend service that you write and should ultimately be pulled from an open public API.
Here’s an example list of API’s curated on GitHub, [public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) but feel free to use any public API you wish.

## @angular/cli details

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.2.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
